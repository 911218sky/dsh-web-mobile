/**
 * Transparent response compression for large JSON payloads.
 *
 * Long sessions make `session.history` responses megabytes of JSON; on a
 * phone that is a slow, data-hungry transfer. This module patches
 * `http.ServerResponse.prototype` (process-wide, restored on dispose) so any
 * JSON response the host serves — the harness's own `/api/*` routes included —
 * is compressed when the client accepts it:
 *
 * - The client's `Accept-Encoding` picks the codec: `br` (brotli, quality 6)
 *   preferred, `gzip` fallback.
 * - Only JSON responses of at least MIN_JSON_BYTES are compressed; small
 *   JSON and every other content type (HTML, static assets, ZIP, SSE streams)
 *   pass through byte-identical with the original headers.
 * - The response header write is deferred until the body is known, so the
 *   decision (compress or not) is made on the actual size, and `Content-Length`
 *   always matches what is sent. Non-JSON responses call the original
 *   `writeHead` immediately and are never touched.
 *
 * The browser's fetch decompresses transparently, so no client change is
 * needed. SSE (`text/event-stream`) is intentionally left uncompressed: it is
 * a continuous stream and the /api bridge never buffers it.
 *
 * Known limitations (issue #80): while a response is deferred, write()
 * reports unconditional success (true) — the socket is untouched, so no
 * backpressure signal exists; buffered write() completion callbacks replay
 * fire-once, in order, right after the real end(), without error propagation
 * (the real flush cannot fail them individually).
 *
 * On dispose (plugin unload / hot-reload), in-flight deferred responses are
 * flushed uncompressed via a live Set (WeakMap alone is not iterable), then
 * the prototype methods are restored.
 *
 * Ported from community fork wzxmt-zhc/dsh-web-mobile (v2.5.0).
