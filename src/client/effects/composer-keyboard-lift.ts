/**
 * Issue #149 mitigation: keep the iOS keyboard's composer above the system
 * form-assistant bar.
 *
 * Root cause (host side, unfixed through dsh-client-ui-conversation
 * 0.2.1-alpha.1): the bundled Lexical selection-scroll helper compares its
 * window-branch visible band `[visualViewport.offsetTop, offsetTop + height]`
 * — LAYOUT coordinates — with the caret's `getBoundingClientRect` — VISUAL
 * coordinates. The frames only agree at window scroll 0, which holds on
 * desktop and Android (adjustResize shrinks the layout viewport and keeps
 * scroll at 0). The iOS keyboard instead forces a nonzero window scroll (the
 * reporter's iPhone 13 Pro: 417 = 844 − 427), so every keystroke computes a
 * bogus negative `window.scrollBy(0, f)` (−158px) that drops the sticky
 * composer seat — and with it the text row, send button and stats row —
 * behind the keyboard. Upstream family: Lexical #8848/#6277, WebKit 46bfd8e.
 *
 * Mitigation contract (derivation in tests/composer-keyboard-lift.test.ts):
 * - iOS WebKit only, mobile branch only, and only while the composer editing
 *   surface holds focus.
 * - The lift comes from screen-space quantities only: the seat's
 *   `getBoundingClientRect().bottom` against `visualViewport.height`. No
 *   layout-viewport quantity (inner height, vh units, scroll-padding) may
 *   enter the math — that mixup is the incident itself.
 * - Fail open (lift 0, the known status quo) whenever the screen-space model
 *   is unverified: pinch `vv.scale !== 1`, or `scrollY` and `vv.offsetTop`
 *   disagreeing beyond tolerance (a visual-viewport pan, or an engine that
 *   changes its keyboard-scroll model, separates the channels).
 * - A rect already includes the transform we applied, so the adapter adds
 *   the applied lift back before comparing — without that the fixed point
 *   self-cancels and oscillates.
 * - Every listener, the rAF and the inline transform die on focusout or
 *   disposal.
 *
 * DOM contract (docs/debug/composer-tree-recon.md): the seat
 * `[class*="_composerSeat"]` is host-owned and hashed (the substring is
 * unique against `_composerStack`) and wraps the card AND the stats row, so
 * one transform lifts the whole block; scope it under the frame marker. The
 * focus anchor `[data-composer-input]` is the Lexical surface, the same
 * marker composer-keyboard-guard.ts audits.
 *
 * The active path cannot be verified headless (`detectIosWebKit` is false in
 * chromium, pitfalls §键盘 guard); acceptance is the reporter's device.
