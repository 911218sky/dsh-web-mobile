/**
 * Mobile guard: entering a session must not raise the soft keyboard by itself.
 *
 * `dsh-client-ui-conversation`'s InputBar focuses the Lexical editor from a
 * passive effect keyed on `[locked, sessionId, editor]` — every session switch
 * programmatically focuses the editing surface (`focusDraftEditor`:
 * `getRootElement()?.focus(...)` plus `editor.focus(...)`). On desktop that is
 * a convenience. On a phone it costs the user half the screen the moment the
 * session opens — they typically want to READ the history first (issue #140).
 *
 * Fix strategy: on a snapshot-observed current-session change, open a short
 * guard window and shadow the editor's own `focus` property (the same
 * own-property recipe as `composer-keyboard-guard.ts`, sharing its marker) so
 * the host's session-switch autofocus lands on the no-op. A real tap is
 * unaffected: the browser focuses natively and never routes through the JS
 * method. The window is finite (see the constant) and also closes early when
 * the user taps the editing surface, so no legitimate programmatic refocus
 * (e.g. the `+` command menu, which needs the caret) is swallowed after the
 * switch has settled.
 *
 * Timing: the host focus runs in a PASSIVE effect, which React schedules after
 * commit — a MutationObserver callback is a microtask and therefore runs
 * before it (measured precedent: `shortcut-modal-keyboard-guard.ts` header).
 * Session switches remount the InputBar (the editor is Session-owned), so the
 * observer re-shadows the freshly mounted `[data-composer-input]` inside the
 * window; arming also shadows an already-present input for switches that
 * reuse the element.
 *
 * DOM contract (verified against 0.1.7-rc.2):
 * - `[data-composer-input]` — the Lexical contenteditable surface (count=1;
 *   present in every released host since 0.1.2-alpha.2, per
 *   docs/debug/composer-tree-recon.md).
 * - `data-mobile-nav-focus-shadow` — the shared shadow marker.
 * Re-audit when the conversation package upgrades.
